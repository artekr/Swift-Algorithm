# Tree

Typical tree types are:

- Tries
- [Binary Trees](../binary_tree)
- [Binary Search Trees(BST)](../binary_search_tree)
  - AVL Trees
  - Red-Black Trees(RBT)

Common tree traversal algorithms

- Depth-first traversal
- Level-order traversal

## AVL Trees

In 1962, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis came up with the first **self-balancing binary search tree**: The **AVL Tree**. This is to solve the performance issue where an unbalanced the BST will degrade the time complexity to **O(n)**.
