# Binary Search

Binary search is a very efficient searching algorithms with a time complexity of **O(log n)**. It is similar with searching for an element inside a **balanced** binary search tree. Two conditions must be applied in order to perform a binary search:

1. The collection must be able to perform index manipulation in constant time. This means that the collection must be a _RandomAccessCollection_. Like Array.
2. The collection must be **sorted**.
